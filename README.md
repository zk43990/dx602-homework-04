# DX 602 Homework 04

## Instructions

You have three options for running the assignment notebook:
* **Option A**: Download and run locally in your own Jupyter environment.
* **Option B**: Open and run directly in GitHub Codespaces.
* **Option C**: Upload and run in Google Colab.

Choose whichever option works best for your situation.

### Downloading the Assignment from GitHub

* Visit the homework repository. This should be where you found this README. Otherwise, you can find it in the [course homework repository list](https://github.com/orgs/bu-cds-dx602/repositories).
* Click on **homework.ipynb** to view the notebook.
* Depending on your chosen option:
  * **Option A or C**: Click on the notebook and select **Download Raw File** to save it to your local machine. Repeat this process for the data files too. <img width="221" height="85" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d01095a-080b-45e3-98e9-7b1cf3dff054" />
